# Hi, I'm <span style="color: #30c67c;">dekulow</span>

Passionate about tech since I was a kid, I'm now a student at the 42 school.</br> My interest in programming began with my discovery of video games ðŸŽ® (and especially cheatware ðŸ‘¾).

After spending hours on learning sites (openclassroom formerly "site du zÃ©ro" in french) to understand how they work, I learned to code my first program and became even more intrigued.</br>
Since then, my curiosity has only increased and I never tire of learning something new every day.

I love sharing my passion with others (irl) and soon maybe online too.

In the meantime, I'm off to discover C, Golang ...
